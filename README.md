### Project Title

**RAG-app** â€“ Your chill AI buddy for retrieval-augmented generation, running smooth on Streamlit

---

### Whatâ€™s This?

RAG-app is your dope Streamlit-based RAG system that lets you build slick AI apps using documents or datasets. Handles all that vector-store integration and LLM orchestration â€” all in a sleek, shareable web UI. Perfect for creating tools, search, knowledge assistants, or any smart interface on top of your data.

### Features

* **Streamlit-powered UI** â€” Frontend thatâ€™s fast, clean, and hella user-friendly.
* **Retrieval + Generation** â€” Combines vector retrieval (Chroma, FAISS, etc.) with LLMs to answer smartly.
* **Flexible vector backend** â€” Easily switch between different vector stores.
* **Cloud-native** â€” Deploys out-of-the-box on Streamlit Community Cloud.
* **Simple environment setup** â€” Manage dependencies with `uv`, `pyproject.toml`, or your preferred method.

---

### Prereqs

* Python 3.12
* Use `uv` (preferred), or `pip` / `poetry`
* Optional: `chromadb` if you want Chroma; otherwise, Pythonâ€™s built-in `sqlite3` or FAISS will work.

---

### Getting Started

1. Clone it:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FazeelAr/RAG-app.git
   cd RAG-app
   ```

2. Set up environment:

   * With `uv`:

     ```bash
     uv install
     ```
   * Or with `pip`:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. (Optional) Add Chroma for better vector store support:

   ```bash
   uv add chromadb
   ```

4. Launch the app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

5. Open the UI in your browser, upload docs, ask questions, and let the LLM do its magic.

| `main.py`                                       | Entry pointâ€”sets up Streamlit UI and triggers the ingestion+LLM flow.   |
| `src/`                                          | Core logic like `vector_store.py`, data loading, and RAG orchestration. |
| `config/`, `data/`                              | Optional zones for configs or sample data.                              |
| `.devcontainer/`                                | Setup for reproducible dev environment (VS Code friendly).              |
| `uv.lock`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml` | Dependency management files.                                            |

### Tips & Best Practices

* If `pysqlite3` causes issues on Windows, just use:

  ```python
  import sqlite3
  ```
* Prefer FAISS if you want a dependency-light vector DB:

  ```python
  from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
  ```
